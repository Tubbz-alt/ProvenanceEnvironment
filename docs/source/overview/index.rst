Overview
========

Proven is a hybrid data platform (HPD) that supports modeling and simulation (M&S) studies and workflow reproducibility by combining an off the shelf (OSS) time-series database, a triple store, and real-time streaming technologies.   Proven can be currently used by InfluxDB, relies on an internal Sesame triple store, and uses the Hazelcast In-Memory-Data-Grid (IMDG). 

The initial version 1.0 release of Proven used to support reproducibility can be found on the ProvenanceEnvironnent main website.  The GridApps-D project uses proven-docker as a means to deploy Proven as part of its application developer system.  The current proven development is located on proven-cluster, proven-client, and proven-docker.
